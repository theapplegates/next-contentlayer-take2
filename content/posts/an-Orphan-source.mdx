> An orphan source is a self-contained radioactive source that is no longer under regulatory control.
> 
> The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines an orphan source more exactly as:[1]
> 
> ...a sealed source of radioactive material contained in a small volume—but not radioactively contaminated soils and bulk metals—in any one or more of the following conditions
> 
> In an uncontrolled condition that requires removal to protect public health and safety from a radiological threat
> Controlled or uncontrolled, but for which a responsible party cannot be readily identified
> Controlled, but the material's continued security cannot be assured. If held by a licensee, the licensee has few or no options for, or is incapable of providing for, the safe disposition of the material
> In the possession of a person, not licensed to possess the material, who did not seek to possess the material
> In the possession of a State radiological protection program for the sole purpose of mitigating a radiological threat because the orphan source is in one of the conditions described in one of the first four bullets and for which the State does not have a means to provide for the material's appropriate disposition
> Most known orphan sources were, generally, small radioactive sources produced legitimately under governmental regulation and put into service for radiography, generating electricity in radioisotope thermoelectric generators, medical radiotherapy or irradiation.[citation needed] These sources were then "abandoned, lost, misplaced or stolen" and so no longer subject to proper regulation.[2]
